High-Level Design (HLD)
1. Architecture Overview:
Frontend:

Framework: React JS
Components: Homepage, AuthPage, Product Listing, Cart, User Profile, and Checkout Page.
State Management: React Context API or Redux (for managing state across components).
Routing: React Router (for navigating between different pages).
Backend:

Framework: Java Spring Boot
Components: REST API Services, Authentication Service, User Management, Product Management, Order Processing.
Database: MySQL (for storing user data, product information, orders, etc.).
Security: Spring Security (for authentication and authorization).
External Services:

Payment Gateway: For handling payments.
Email Service: For sending order confirmations and notifications.
2. System Components:
Frontend:

Homepage: Displays the gift cards with options for Zomato, Swiggy, Flipkart, Amazon.
AuthPage: Allows users to log in or register.
Product Listing Page: Shows details of available gift cards.
Cart Page: Users can view and manage their selected gift cards.
Checkout Page: Users can finalize their purchase.
Profile Page: Users can view and edit their personal details.
Backend:

User Management Service: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
Product Service: Manages gift card details and availability.
Order Service: Processes orders and handles payment transactions.
Email Service: Sends out order confirmations and other notifications.
3. Data Flow:
User Interaction:

Users visit the Homepage to browse available gift cards.
They add gift cards to their cart and proceed to the Checkout Page.
Backend Interaction:

Frontend makes API calls to the backend services for retrieving gift card details, managing user sessions, processing orders, etc.
Payment transactions are processed through a payment gateway.
Post-Transaction:

Confirmation and notifications are sent to users via email.
Order details are saved in the database.
Low-Level Design (LLD)
1. Frontend Components:
Homepage Component:

Displays a carousel with images.
Shows available gift cards with options to view details or add to cart.
AuthPage Component:

Contains forms for user login and registration.
Manages authentication state and redirects upon successful login.
Product Listing Component:

Displays gift card details fetched from the backend.
Allows users to add items to their cart.
Cart Component:

Lists items added to the cart.
Provides options to update quantities or remove items.
Checkout Component:

Collects user shipping and payment information.
Processes the payment and confirms the order.
Profile Component:

Allows users to view and update their profile information.
2. Backend Components:
User Management Service:

Endpoints:
POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/users/login: Authenticate a user.
GET /api/users/{id}: Retrieve user profile details.
PUT /api/users/{id}: Update user profile.
Product Service:

Endpoints:
GET /api/products: Retrieve list of available gift cards.
GET /api/products/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific gift card.
Order Service:

Endpoints:

GET /api/orders/{id}: Retrieve order details.
PUT /api/orders/{id}: Update order status.
Email Service:

Endpoints:
POST /api/email/send: Send an email notification.
3. Database Schema:
User Table:

id: UUID
username: String
passwordHash: String
email: String
createdAt: Timestamp
updatedAt: Timestamp
Product Table:

id: UUID
name: String
description: String
price: Decimal
imageUrl: String
createdAt: Timestamp
updatedAt: Timestamp
Order Table:

id: UUID
userId: UUID
productIds: Array of UUIDs
totalAmount: Decimal
status: String
createdAt: Timestamp
updatedAt: Timestamp
Implementation Notes:
Frontend:

Use React Hooks for managing state and lifecycle events.
Apply CSS-in-JS or SCSS for styling components.
Backend:

Implement RESTful APIs following best practices.
Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
Ensure proper exception handling and logging.
